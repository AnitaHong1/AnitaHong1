# Hi there, I'm Anita 👋  
## A recent CS grad from SUNY Binghamton and COOP Data Fellow!
I'm a curious builder, empathetic problem-solver, and data + tech enthusiast.  
I care about creating tools that are actually useful—and explaining things in a way that makes sense.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps and React Native
- 🧠 COOP Data Fellow + former Coding Instructor at iCode
- 🛠️ I like making apps that solve real-life problems
- ✨ Fun fact: I love mangos, stargazing, and cozy dramas
