# Hi there, I'm Anita 👋  
## A recent CS grad from SUNY Binghamton and COOP Data Fellow!

I'm a curious builder who’s slowly relearning to love code after burnout.  
I create comforting, quirky apps that solve real-life (and emotional) problems—and explain tech in a way that feels safe.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning DevOps, React Native, and AI-powered app design  
- 🧠 COOP Data Fellow + former coding instructor at Girls Who Code  
- 🛠️ I like making apps that are part productivity tool, part emotional hug  
- ✨ Fun fact: I love mangos, stargazing, and cozy dramas
